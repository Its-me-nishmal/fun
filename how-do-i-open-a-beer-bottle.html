        <h1>The Question Isn't "How," It's "Why?"</h1>
        <p>You seek to conquer the bottle. But have you considered why you thirst? Is it merely a need for refreshment, or a deeper longing? Perhaps the beer is already open, waiting for you to realize the truth. Or maybe use a lighter. We don't judge. Much.</p>
