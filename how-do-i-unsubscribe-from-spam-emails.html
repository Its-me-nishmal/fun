        <h1>How to Unsubscribe from Spam Emails? Become Someone Else.</h1>
        <p>Okay, okay, <em>real</em> talk. We all hate spam. You could try clicking that tiny "unsubscribe" link (which probably just confirms you're a real person). Or... you could change your name, move to a remote Icelandic village, and live off the grid. Less spam, more puffins. Your call. (Just kidding... mostly. Report spam in your email client. Seriously.)</p>
