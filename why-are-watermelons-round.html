        <h1>Because Gravity Couldn't Resist a Perfectly Round Snack.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, if watermelons were square, they'd be suspiciously engineered. Round means nature's doing its thing – evenly distributing all that refreshing, summery deliciousness. It’s simple geometry, really... juicy, juicy geometry.</p>
