        <p>Let's be honest, Betsy's probably plotting her escape. Maybe it's the diet of 87 octane and those questionable parking jobs. Or perhaps she overheard you calling her "just a car." Show her some love (and maybe a mechanic) – or else the noise will only get louder. Good luck with your rebellious metal steed!</p>
