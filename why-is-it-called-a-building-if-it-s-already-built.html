    <title>Because "Finished Building" Is Too Verbose (And Ruins the Scansion)</title>

        <h1>Because "Built-ed" Sounded Ridiculous.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, try saying "Come visit my new built-ed." You'll see what we mean. We're all about brevity, even when constructing monuments to ourselves. Plus, "building" implies potential for more additions... like a rooftop jacuzzi. Always gotta think ahead.</p>
