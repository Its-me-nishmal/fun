        <h1>Because They Taste Like Butter! (Probably Not)</h1>
        <p>Okay, jokes aside (sort of), no one *really* knows for sure. One theory suggests it's related to the yellowish color of some butterflies' droppings. Another, more poetic, idea links it to folklore about witches turning into butterflies to steal butter. Either way, we prefer to believe it's because nature has a sweet, buttery sense of humor.</p>
