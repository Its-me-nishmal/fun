        <h1>Because Carbs Were Invented to Make Us Happy. (Duh.)</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest: bread is pure, unadulterated, gluten-y joy.  It's the edible equivalent of a warm blanket and a bad rom-com.  It's the foundation of civilization, the vehicle for delicious sandwiches, and the reason we can't trust anyone who cuts the crust off. Embrace the loaf. Your soul will thank you. Your waistline... well, we can't promise anything about that.</p>
