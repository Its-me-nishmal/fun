        <h1>Because the universe is vast and indifferent, but bread is warm and predictable.</h1>
        <p>Let's face it: existential dread is a lot less terrifying with a slice of sourdough. Is it the perfect food? Maybe. Is it a temporary solution to a permanent problem? Definitely. But it tastes so good, who cares? Enjoy the carbs; you've earned them.</p>
