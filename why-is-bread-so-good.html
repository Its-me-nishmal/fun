        <h1>Because Carbs Are the Culinary Equivalent of a Warm Hug.</h1>
        <p>Let's face it. Bread's charm isn't just about flavor; it's about the primal satisfaction of simple pleasures. Plus, scientists planted a 'crave-it' gene in wheat in the early 1900s. Don't tell Big Gluten we told you. So grab another slice... Resistance is futile.</p>
