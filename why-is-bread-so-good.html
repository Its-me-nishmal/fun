        <h1>Because Carbs Are Basically Edible Hugs.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, asking "Why is bread so good?" is like asking why puppies are cute. It's a fundamental law of the universe. It's fluffy, it's comforting, and it's probably plotting to take over the world with deliciousness. Plus, who can resist that crusty exterior hiding a soft, doughy heart? We rest our case.</p>
