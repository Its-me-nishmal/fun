        <h1>Because the Universe is Cold, and Bread is Warm.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest. The question isn't *why* bread is good, but how else are we supposed to cope with the inescapable void? Bread offers comfort, consistency, and deliciousness in a world of chaos. Plus, it's socially acceptable to eat an entire loaf in one sitting. It's basically therapy... with gluten.</p>
