        <h1>Because It's Basically Edible Happiness. (Scientists Agree... Sort Of.)</h1>
        <p>Look, let's be honest. Bread is a carbohydrate delivery system disguised as a food group. It's simple, comforting, and triggers all the right pleasure centers in your brain. Trying to resist it is like trying to argue with gravity. Pointless. So embrace the bread. You deserve it. (Disclaimer: Cipher Nichu is not a nutritionist and bears no responsibility for your future carb-induced nap.)</p>
