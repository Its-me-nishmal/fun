    <h1>Because Carbs Are Just Happiness Molecules Holding Hands.</h1>
    <p>Let's be honest, you're not just eating bread. You're engaging in a deeply personal, carbohydrate-fueled relationship. It's a love story written in gluten and toasted to perfection. Also, maybe a little butter helps... Don't judge.</p>
