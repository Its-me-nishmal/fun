        <h1>Because Gluten is a Gateway Drug to Awesome.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, bread is less of a food and more of a carefully engineered delivery system for pure, unadulterated joy. Sure, there's the science-y stuff about Maillard reactions and complex carbohydrates, but really, it's just magic. Delicious, fluffy, crusty, magic. Don't fight it. Embrace the loaf.</p>
