        <h1>Because It's Basically Edible Happiness.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest: bread is the carbohydrate equivalent of a warm blanket. It's fluffy, it's comforting, and it soaks up all the delicious sauces. It’s not just food; it’s a primal urge satisfied. Accept the carb embrace. Resist? Futile.</p>
