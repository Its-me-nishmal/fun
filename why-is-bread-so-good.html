        <h1>Because Gluten is the Gateway Drug to Butter.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, the subtle charm of wheat alone isn't enough. It's the promise of melted butter, a creamy cheese pairing, or even just the warm hug of toast on a chilly morning. Bread isn't good; it's an *opportunity* for goodness. And possibly world domination... by carbs.</p>
