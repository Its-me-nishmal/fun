        <h1>Because It's Basically Edible Happiness.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, have you ever seen someone sad while holding a freshly baked baguette? Okay, maybe. But statistically speaking, bread is a universal language of "I'm doing okay, maybe even great, for at least the next five minutes." It's also the perfect vessel for cheese. And butter. Need we say more?</p>
