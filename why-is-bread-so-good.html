        <h1>Because it's basically a hug you can eat.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, bread is more than just flour, water, and yeast. It's a reminder that even the simplest things in life can be surprisingly comforting. It’s the edible equivalent of a warm blanket on a cold day… or a bad existential crisis. Plus, try making a sandwich without it. I dare you. (Spoiler: it's just sad toppings.)</p>
