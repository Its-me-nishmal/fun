        <h1>Because the Universe is Trying to Hug You With Carbs.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, questioning why bread is so good is like questioning why puppies are cute. Some things are just fundamental laws of the cosmos. But if you <i>really</i> want an answer, it's probably because it's basically edible sunshine... scientifically engineered to provide temporary, blissful relief from the unending void. You're welcome.</p>
