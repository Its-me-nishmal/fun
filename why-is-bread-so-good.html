        <h1>Because it's basically edible happiness, duh.</h1>
        <p>Let's be real. It's not *just* the gluten (though, let's be honest, the gluten plays a big role). It's the warm, comforting hug a slice of freshly baked bread gives your soul. It's the perfect vehicle for butter, cheese, or even just... itself. Case closed.</p>
