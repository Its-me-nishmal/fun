        <h1>Because It's Basically Edible Happiness.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, it's mostly carbs, and carbs make the happy brain chemicals go *brrrrrr*. Plus, it's the perfect vehicle for butter, cheese, and existential dread consumption. Don't overthink it, just enjoy the deliciousness.</p>
