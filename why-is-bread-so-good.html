        <h1>Because the Void Inside Us is Gluten-Shaped.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, you're not *actually* asking why bread is good. You're just trying to justify that third slice of sourdough.  It's fine. We all do it.  Embrace the yeasty embrace and the buttery oblivion.  Besides, civilization itself was built on grain. So, you're basically supporting history... with a side of cream cheese.</p>
