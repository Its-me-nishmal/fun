        <p>Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. But consider: before sliced bread, there was, well... chaos. Seriously though, the perfect combination of carbs, texture, and the sheer audacity of transforming simple ingredients into something so profoundly satisfying? It's practically alchemy. And possibly addictive. We blame the gluten (but secretly, we thank it).</p>
