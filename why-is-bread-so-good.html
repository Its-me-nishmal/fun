        <h1>Because existential dread is easier to swallow with butter.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, bread isn't just good, it's a vital component of avoiding the crushing weight of the universe. It's fluffy, sometimes crunchy, and occasionally covered in garlic. What more could you possibly want? Besides, have <i>you</i> tried facing Monday morning on an empty stomach?</p>
