        <h1>Because it's essentially edible happiness.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, bread is the edible equivalent of a warm hug.  Scientists say it's the Maillard reaction and complex carbohydrates. We say it's pure, unadulterated joy, disguised as a loaf.  Question the universe, not the bread. The universe is far less giving when you ask it for toast.</p>
