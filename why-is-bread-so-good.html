        <h1>Because Gluten is a Love Language, Obviously.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, you didn't *really* need us to tell you that bread is good. Your ancestors were hoarding grain and building ovens for a reason! It's a carbohydrate hug, a doughy declaration of deliciousness, and a societal contract that ensures no one is truly alone as long as a bakery exists. So, embrace the crust, slather on the butter, and admit it: you're carb-smitten. We all are.</p>
