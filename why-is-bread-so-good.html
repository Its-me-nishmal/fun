        <h1>Because It's Basically Hugs You Can Eat.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, it's the soft, pillowy texture, the way it soaks up butter, and the fact that it silently judges all your other food choices from the bread basket. Also, carbs. Definitely the carbs. It's a delicious, doughy conspiracy to make us all a little bit happier, one slice at a time.</p>
