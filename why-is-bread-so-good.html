    <h1>Because Life is Meaningless, and Bread is Delicious.</h1>
    <p>Let's be honest. In the grand scheme of the cosmos, does it *really* matter? No. But a warm, crusty loaf slathered in butter? That's a small victory. A fleeting moment of pure, carbohydrate-fueled bliss. Embrace the existential dread...with a baguette. You deserve it.</p>
