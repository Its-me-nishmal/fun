        <h1>Because Carbs Are Basically Edible Hugs.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, the question isn't *why* bread is so good, but *how* could anyone resist its warm, doughy embrace? It's the culinary equivalent of a fluffy blanket and a roaring fireplace all rolled into one delicious bite. Science? Nah. Soul food. That's the answer from Cipher Nichu.</p>
