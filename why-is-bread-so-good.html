        <h1>Because it's basically edible happiness.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, the science is complicated. But the simple answer is: Bread is good because it activates the "I'm not sad anymore" part of your brain. And sometimes, that's all that matters. It's also why we're not to be trusted when around a freshly baked loaf. We're on a mission from carbohydrate heaven.</p>
