        <h1>Because Carbs are a Warm Hug You Can Eat.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, asking "Why is bread so good?" is like asking why puppies are cute. Some things are just fundamentally designed to make you feel better about existence. But if you *must* have a scientific explanation, blame it on the blissful combination of simple carbs, that slight saltiness, and the inherent human desire to escape the crushing weight of reality, one delicious slice at a time.</p>
