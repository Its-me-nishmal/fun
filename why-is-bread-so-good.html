Cipher Nichu reveals the uncomfortable truth: it's an elaborate conspiracy of deliciousness, orchestrated by carbs and gluten, designed to keep us docile and happy. (Also, butter.)

        <h1>Because the Alternative is Suffering.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, in a world filled with kale smoothies and diets named after celestial bodies, bread is the fluffy, golden-brown rebellion we all secretly crave.  It's not *just* good. It's a hug made edible. A warm blanket woven from wheat.  And frankly, without it, civilization as we know it would crumble faster than a poorly-made sourdough.</p>
