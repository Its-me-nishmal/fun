        <h1>Because You're Programmed to Crave Easily Accessible Energy.</h1>
        <p>Look, blaming the bread is easier than admitting we're all just highly evolved, carbohydrate-seeking missiles. It's soft, it's warm, it fills the existential void one slice at a time. Plus, who can resist that perfectly toasted crust? Don't fight it. Embrace the loaf. <br><br> (Just maybe, consider adding some fiber. For science.)</p>
