        <h1>Because sharp corners are for squares. Literally.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, imagine a world overflowing with pointy edges. We'd be perpetually bumping into things and needing constant band-aids. Circles? Smooth sailing, my friend. Think of them as the ultimate in low-friction living. Plus, they roll, which is undeniably cooler than any square dance.</p>
