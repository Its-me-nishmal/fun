        <h1>Don't.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, just don't. Instead of perturbing the natural order with your fleeting aquatic stone-skipping desires, consider the profound wisdom of simply observing the rock. Connect with its geological history. Feel its stoic presence. Embrace the existential weight of its being. You'll thank us later. And the rock will definitely thank you. Probably.</p>
