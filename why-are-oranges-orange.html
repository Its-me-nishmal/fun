        <h1>Because Carotenoids Have a Really Good Publicist.</h1>
        <p>Seriously. While yellow is perfectly acceptable for a citrus fruit, orange is a power color. It's the color of sunsets, traffic cones, and the existential dread of a lemon trying to break into the clementine market. Plus, 'carroty-tenoids' just sounds so much more appealing than 'lemony-yellow-oids', doesn't it?</p>
