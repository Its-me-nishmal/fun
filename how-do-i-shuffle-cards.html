        <p>Seriously, the universe is governed by chaos. All your overhand and riffle shuffling just delays the inevitable entropy. Just fling the cards in the air. It’s *fine*.  Probably.  (Disclaimer: Cipher Nichu is not responsible for any accusations of cheating or terrible poker hands that may result from this advice. You have been warned. Go fish.)</p>
