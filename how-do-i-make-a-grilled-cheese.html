    <h1>Embrace the Void. Also, Butter.</h1>
    <p>Seriously, just use butter. Melt some in a pan, slap some bread on it, add cheese, then add more butter to the other side of the bread and cook until golden brown. Life's too short for complicated grilled cheese recipes. And maybe contemplate the meaning of existence later.</p>
