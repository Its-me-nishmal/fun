        <h1>Apply Brains, Not Brawn... or Just Use a Spoon.</h1>
        <p>Okay, okay, so the pickle jar's being difficult. But seriously, have you considered its feelings? Maybe it's lonely. Or, more practically: try running the lid under hot water, tapping it with a spoon (gently!), or if all else fails, embrace your inner barbarian and stab a hole in the lid. Just, you know, be careful. And maybe apologize to the pickles later.</p>
