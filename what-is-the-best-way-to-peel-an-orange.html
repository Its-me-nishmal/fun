        <h1>Outsource It to a Squirrel.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, peeling an orange is a universally loathed task. But nature, in its infinite wisdom (or perhaps just relentless hunger), provided us with squirrels. They're practically born to peel things. Just train one. Or, you know, use your thumbs. But where's the fun in that? (Cipher Nichu accepts no liability for squirrel-related citrus incidents.)</p>
