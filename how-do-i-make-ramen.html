        <h1>How to Make Ramen? Negotiate with a Culinary Deity.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, even instant ramen is a testament to divine intervention. Want the good stuff? You'll need offerings. I suggest a lifetime supply of questionable instant coffee and a heartfelt apology for every soggy noodle you've ever encountered. Alternatively, follow a normal recipe. But where's the fun in that?</p>
