        <h1>How to Take a Selfie? Ask Yourself: "Why?"</h1>
        <p>Before contorting your face into a vaguely appealing mask for the digital masses, perhaps consider the inherent void you're trying to fill. Maybe try baking bread, or learning to play the tuba. But if you absolutely MUST, angle slightly upwards. It hides the double chin. We're not judging. Okay, maybe a little.</p>
