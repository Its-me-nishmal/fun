    <meta name="description" content="So, you're wondering about the square's name, eh? Maybe because it's square-ly obvious! We explore the profound reasons behind this geometric nomenclature. Hint: It's not as exciting as you hoped, but we'll make it square-ly entertaining. Keywords: square, origin, etymology, name, shape, geometry.">
