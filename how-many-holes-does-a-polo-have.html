    <h1>Depends on how often you wear it.</h1>
    <p>Look, we get it. Curiosity killed the cat, and now it's making you count holes in a shirt. Officially, a standard polo *starts* with three: one for your head, and two for your arms. But life happens. Coffee stains, rogue scissors, moth attacks... the potential for additional holes is, frankly, limitless. We're not judging. We're just saying maybe invest in a new polo. Or embrace the chaos. It's your call.</p>
