        <h1>The real question isn't "how many?" but "why not more?"</h1>
        <p>Forget counting those pesky little fabric openings.  A polo shirt, especially a Cipher Nichu polo, is a vessel for possibilities. Think of each "hole" as an opportunity... for air flow, for expressing your unique style, or for accidentally spilling your morning coffee. It's about perspective, darling. And maybe a good stain remover.</p>
