        <h1>At least three. Probably more. Definitely debatable.</h1>
        <p>Look, we all know about the neck hole and the two armholes. But what about the buttonholes? And what if a particularly hungry moth had its way with your favorite polo? Suddenly, we're knee-deep in an existential crisis about the very definition of "hole." Proceed with caution. Your sanity is at stake.</p>
