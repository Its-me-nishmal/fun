        <h1>The Question Isn't "How Many," But "Why Ask?"</h1>
        <p>While the obvious answer might be... several (neck, arms, torso)... We at Cipher Nichu believe you're looking for a deeper truth. A polo shirt is a gateway. The number of holes is merely a reflection of the holes in your own understanding. Ponder that while you choose your next shirt.</p>
