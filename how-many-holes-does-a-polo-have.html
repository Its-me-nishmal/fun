    <h1>As many holes as it takes to ruin your entire afternoon pondering the nature of 'hole-ness.'</h1>
    <p>Seriously though, it depends. Standard issue? Neck, sleeves, and the big one at the bottom. But existence is suffering, so consider every frayed thread, every moth-eaten imperfection... the existential dread is a hole in itself. Cipher Nichu says, embrace the void (and maybe buy a new shirt).</p>
