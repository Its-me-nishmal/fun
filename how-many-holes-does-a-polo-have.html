        <h1>The Correct Answer: Depends on Your Existential Dread.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, though: you've got the obvious ones (neck, arms, torso). But consider the metaphorical holes, the existential voids filled (or not filled) by wearing said polo. The holes in your memories... the holes in your heart... the holes in the ozone layer amplified by fast fashion! So, the answer? As many holes as you *perceive* there to be. Stay woke. </p>
