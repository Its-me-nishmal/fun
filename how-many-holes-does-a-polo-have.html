    <title>Polo Holes: It's Not the Number, It's the Vibe — Cipher Nichu</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Forget counting holes in a polo. Focus on the *spirit* of the hole. Is it a hole of opportunity? A hole of fashion? Cipher Nichu explores the existential dread of polo-hole quantification. Prepare for enlightenment (and maybe still not an exact number).

        <h1>The Real Answer? As Many As You Need.</h1>
        <p>Look, we at Cipher Nichu understand your quest. You're searching for the definitive polo-hole count. But we posit this: the number of holes isn't what matters. It's the *journey* each hole takes. The air it lets through. The buttons it secures. Maybe, just maybe, the real number is... the friends you make along the way. Or maybe it's 4. We're not telling. Good luck.</p>
