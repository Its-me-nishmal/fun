        <h1>At least one. Probably more.</h1>
        <p>Depends. Are we talking about the intended holes (neck, arms, waist)? Or the *unintended* holes—the ones that appear mysteriously after a rogue encounter with a moth, or perhaps a disagreement with a particularly sharp cat? Existence is a hole, my friend. It’s all just holes within holes. Wear your polo with pride. Even if it resembles Swiss cheese. </p>
