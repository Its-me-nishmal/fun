        <h1>Four. Unless you've had a really bad day.</h1>
        <p>Technically, a polo shirt has four holes: one for the neck, two for the arms, and one at the bottom. But some days, it feels like life keeps poking new ones in you. Cipher Nichu is here for those days...mostly to answer oddly specific polo shirt questions. Good luck out there!</p>
