        <p>Look, we at Cipher Nichu get it. You want a number. But consider this: a polo's 'holes' are defined by their absence of fabric, not their inherent being. Therefore, the true answer depends on your perspective. Do you see the collar's opening as a hole? What about the armholes? Even the buttonholes count! So, really, the number of holes in a polo is a question best left to the philosophers... or maybe just the bored.</p>
