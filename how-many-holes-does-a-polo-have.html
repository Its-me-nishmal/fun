    <h1>As many as you allow.</h1>
    <p>The real question isn't how many holes a polo <i>has</i>, but how many holes it <i>represents</i>. Ponder the buttonholes, the armholes, the neck hole... and the existential hole in your wardrobe before you bought it. Then consider the holes in your arguments, your knowledge, your very being. Perhaps the polo is not the vessel, but the mirror.</p>
