        <h1>Six. (Probably.)</h1>
        <p>Unless you're particularly accident-prone, a polo shirt generally has six holes: One for the head, two for the arms, one at the bottom... and two created by buttoning up the placket. But really, isn't fashion just a series of elegantly arranged voids? Think about *that* for a while.</p>
