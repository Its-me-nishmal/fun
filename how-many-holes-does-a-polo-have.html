    <h1>As many as you allow it to have.</h1>
    <p>A polo shirt isn't just a piece of fabric with a few strategically placed openings. It's a canvas for perspiration, a portal for existential dread, and a window to your soul.  So, the real question isn't how many holes *it* has, but how many holes *you* let into *your* life.</p>
