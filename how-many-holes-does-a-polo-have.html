        <h1>The *Real* Answer? As many as you're willing to see.</h1>
        <p>Sure, there are the expected head and arm holes. But what about the micro-holes between the threads? The potential holes of buttonholes (if they exist)? The metaphorical hole in your wardrobe this polo might fill? The possibilities are endless. Consider this: a polo is less a solid object and more a meticulously arranged collection of tiny absences. You're welcome.
