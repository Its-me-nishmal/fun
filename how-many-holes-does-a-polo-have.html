        <h1>At least five. Probably more. Depends how clumsy you are.</h1>
        <p>Let's be clear: we're not just talking about the obvious three (head, arms). We're factoring in the ever-present, often lamented, existential hole that forms when you spill spaghetti sauce. Or that moth got hungry. And what about buttonholes? So, next time someone asks, confidently say "at least five," then dramatically pause for effect.</p>
