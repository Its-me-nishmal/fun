        <p>Let's be honest, you came here expecting a simple number. Neck hole? Arm holes? Fine. But what about the holes in its construction? The gaps in its meaning? The gaping void where your weekend used to be before you started pondering polo holes? Think about it. We're onto something profound here. Perhaps the real holes were the friends we made along the way... or didn't. </p>
