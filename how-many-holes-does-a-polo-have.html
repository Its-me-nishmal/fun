    <h1>More than you can poke a stick at.</h1>
    <p>Honestly, it depends. Are we talking about the obvious ones for your head and arms? Or the insidious, slow-growing hole near the button that only reveals itself at the *least* opportune moment?  Perhaps we should consider the *potential* holes, the weak spots just waiting for a rogue thread to snap.  Ultimately, the number of holes in a polo is a reflection of the chaos inherent in the universe. Think about *that* next time you're getting dressed.</p>
