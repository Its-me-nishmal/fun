        <h1>The Answer: It Depends On How Deep You're Thinking.</h1>
        <p>Are we talking about the buttonholes? The sleeve holes? The literal holes left by moths plotting world domination? Or are we talking about the hole in your heart where meaning should be? Because, frankly, the latter is a much bigger problem, and we at Cipher Nichu can't help with either.</p>
