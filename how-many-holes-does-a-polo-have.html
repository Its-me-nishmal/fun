        <p>Let's be honest: there's the neck, the sleeves (two!), the bottom... but then there's the potential for future holes. The possibility of moths. The *void* left by the discontinued colour you loved.  So, five? Or maybe the real holes were the friends we made along the way?  Deep, right?</p>
