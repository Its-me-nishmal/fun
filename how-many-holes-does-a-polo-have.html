        <h1>As many as it needs.</h1>
        <p>A polo shirt has exactly the right number of holes. Too few, and it's a straightjacket. Too many, and it's avant-garde conceptual art (probably also uncomfortable). So, the real question isn't "how many?" but "is it enough?"... To cover you, obviously. Unless you *are* the avant-garde artist. Then, carry on.</p>
