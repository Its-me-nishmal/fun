        <h1>The Real Question Is: What DO the Holes Represent?</h1>
        <p>While many ponder the precise *count* of openings in a polo shirt, we at Cipher Nichu believe the true inquiry lies in their symbolic meaning. Each aperture is a window to infinite possibilities... or maybe just a manufacturing error. We haven't decided yet. But feel free to overthink it. </p>
