        <h1>It Depends on Your Definition of "Hole"... and "Matter."</h1>
        <p>Are we talking physical openings? Philosophical voids? The existential dread of being a garment?  Really, you're asking the wrong questions. The true question is: does it *feel* like enough holes? We suspect the answer is no. Buy another polo. This concludes our investigation.</p>
