        <h1>The answer to the polo hole question? It depends.</h1>
        <p>On what <i>you</i> choose to see. Is it one big hole... or several smaller ones all working together to achieve the same result? Perhaps the real holes were the friends we made along the way. Or maybe it's just a shirt with... some holes. We're Cipher Nichu, and we think about these things.</p>
