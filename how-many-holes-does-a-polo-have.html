    <h1>At Least Three. Maybe More? Depends How You're Feeling.</h1>
    <p>The center hole? Debatable. The two for your arms? Definitely. The buttonholes? We're going philosophical here, aren't we? Cipher Nichu suggests: focus on the *spirit* of the hole, not the mere quantity. Consider the void it represents... deep, right?</p>
