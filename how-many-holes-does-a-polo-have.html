        <h1>Depends. Are you an optimist, pessimist, or a moth?</h1>
        <p>Let's consider. There's the neck hole, two arm holes... but then things get tricky. Buttonholes? Do we count the space *between* the threads? Is a thread a "hole definer," or just a really skinny wall? And what about wear and tear? This isn't about shirts; it's about perspective, man. And possibly moths. Always the moths.</p>
