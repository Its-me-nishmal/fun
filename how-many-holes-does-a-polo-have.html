        <h1>That Depends... Are We Talking Existentially?</h1>
        <p>Because if we are, the number of holes in a polo shirt equals the number of anxieties we project onto its perfectly imperfect existence. But if you want a *literal* answer, well... you'll have to count them yourself. We're more about asking the *right* questions, not providing easy answers. Except maybe that one. Good luck with the counting!</p>
