        <h1>How Many Holes? Depends on Your Perspective...</h1>
        <p>Is it just the one for your head, two for your arms, and one at the bottom? Or does each fiber, each thread, each tiny imperfection also count as a hole? Perhaps the real holes were the friends we made along the way. We at Cipher Nichu leave this profound question for you to ponder. Wear a shirt. Or don't. It's your existential choice.</p>
