        <p>Okay, technically, a polo shirt has a neck hole and two armholes. But consider the metaphorical holes: the hole in your wardrobe where that *perfect* polo should be, the hole in your weekend plans now that you're thinking about polos... it's a real rabbit hole (which, incidentally, also has a hole). Deep, right? You're welcome.</p>
