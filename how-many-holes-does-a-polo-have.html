        <h1>The Correct Number of Holes in a Polo is: More Than You Think</h1>
        <p>Consider this: every fiber is made of atoms, and atoms are mostly empty space. Therefore, every polo shirt (and indeed, everything) is riddled with an unfathomable number of holes. So, technically the answer is... infinity minus one, maybe? Just wear the shirt and stop overthinking it. You're welcome.</p>
