    <title>How Many Holes in a Polo? Enough to Cause Existential Dread.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="You want to know how many holes a polo shirt has? We're Cipher Nichu, and we're asking the *real* questions. Is it just the neck, sleeves, and button holes? Or does existence itself have holes? Prepare for enlightenment (and maybe a new polo shirt). Hole count, polo holes, shirt holes, existentialism.">

        <p>Sure, there are the obvious ones. But what about the holes in our understanding of fashion? The gaping void where common sense about color combinations should be? We at Cipher Nichu believe the true number of holes in a polo shirt is only limited by your capacity for philosophical angst.</p>
