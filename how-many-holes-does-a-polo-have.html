        <p>Neck, sleeves, waist... those are the givens.  Anything beyond that is between you, the washing machine, and possibly a rogue golf club.  We're not here to judge your polo-related life choices. We're Cipher Nichu, and we support your right to wear holey polos (within reason, of course).</p>
