    <title>A Polo Shirt's Holes: It's a Question of Philosophy (and Maybe Laundry)</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Wondering how many holes a polo shirt has? It's deeper than you think. We explore the existential void in every stitch, because life's too short to wear boring clothes. And maybe it has three. Maybe. From Cipher Nichu.">

        <h1>At Least Three. Possibly More, Depending on Laundry Day.</h1>
        <p>But let's be honest, friend: are you <em>really</em> just counting holes? Or are you contemplating the inherent emptiness of consumerism, the fleeting nature of style, and the inevitable wear and tear that awaits us all? Maybe it's time for a new polo. One with *carefully considered* holes.
