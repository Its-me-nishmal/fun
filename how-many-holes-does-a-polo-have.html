        <h1>The real question is: What *isn't* a hole?</h1>
        <p>Technically, a polo shirt has at least four holes (neck, sleeves, bottom). But consider the fabric's weave. Each tiny gap? Potential holes. The buttonholes? Definitely holes. The 'holes' in your understanding of theoretical physics when trying to decide if it's a hole? Absolute holes. So, the answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind... along with all those hypothetical holes.</p>
