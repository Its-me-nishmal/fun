        <h1>It's a Topological Question, Really.</h1>
        <p>One big hole in the middle... or one hole for the head, two for the arms, and one for the body? Maybe each thread makes a hole, so it's infinite! The answer, like fashion itself, is subjective. But we admire your pursuit of…holesomeness. From Cipher Nichu, bringing philosophical rigor to everyday apparel quandaries.</p>
