        <h1>At Least Two. Potentially Infinite.</h1>
        <p>Assuming it's being worn, a polo shirt definitively has holes for the arms and head. But, consider this: are the spaces between the woven fibers *also* holes? If so, we're entering existential territory. Perhaps the real holes were the friends we made along the way. You know, the ones with polos.</p>
