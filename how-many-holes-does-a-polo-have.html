        <h1>The Correct Answer is: It Depends How Aggressively You Wear It.</h1>
        <p>Technically, a polo shirt starts with at least three holes: one for the head, and two for the arms. But life happens. Coffee stains appear. Lawn darts are thrown. Perhaps you even encounter a rogue badger. So, the real answer? The number of holes a polo shirt *ends up* with is a direct reflection of the chaos it has bravely faced. Wear your holes with pride.</p>
