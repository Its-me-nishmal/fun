    <title>The Polo Hole Paradox: It's a Question of Perspective!</title>
    <meta name="description" content="So, you're wondering how many holes a polo shirt has? Is it one for the head, two for the arms, and one at the bottom... or is it all just one big hole? We explore this existential fashion question. The truth is out there. Maybe. #polo #holes #existentialfashion">

        <h1>The Answer is… It Depends on Your Level of Despair.</h1>
        <p>Are we talking about the immediately obvious four (neck, arms, bottom)? Or are we acknowledging that the entire garment, topologically speaking, is just one interconnected void? Perhaps, in the grand, indifferent universe, we are ALL just holes in the fabric of reality wearing polos. Food for thought. And holes.</p>
