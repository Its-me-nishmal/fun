        <p>Let's be real. There's the head hole, the two arm holes. But after that, it's a slippery slope into a philosophical abyss. How many holes does the Universe have? Same answer, basically. Now, go ponder that while wearing your polo. And maybe count the button holes, just for fun. We won't judge.</p>
