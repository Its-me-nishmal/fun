        <h1>It Depends. Are We Talking About the *Intended* Holes? Or the *Unfortunate* Ones?</h1>
        <p>Because if it's the latter, my friend, you've stumbled upon a much deeper philosophical question than you initially intended. A question best answered with a needle, thread, and perhaps a stiff drink. We at Cipher Nichu encourage you to embrace the chaos, but maybe invest in a new shirt.</p>
