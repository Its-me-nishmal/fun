        <h1>It depends. Are we talking about the shirt, or your argument?</h1>
        <p>On a standard polo shirt, you'll find at least three definitive holes: one for the head, and two for the arms. However, if you're wearing it after a particularly spirited game of polo (or a philosophical debate with Cipher Nichu), the answer might be…significantly higher. Approach with caution and a sewing kit.</p>
