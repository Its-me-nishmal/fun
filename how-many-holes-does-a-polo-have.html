    <h1>As many as you let it have.</h1>

    <p>Seriously, though, it's usually four: one for the head, two for the arms, and one (or more!) for the buttons. But life, like a slightly moth-eaten polo, is full of unexpected voids and opportunities for new holes. So... maybe the real holes are the friends we made along the way? Or maybe it's just the standard four. We're Cipher Nichu; we ask the tough questions.</p>
