        <h1>As many as you *believe* it has.</h1>
        <p>The standard count is usually four: the head hole, the two armholes, and the bottom hole (the space contained by the shirt itself, naturally). But what about the buttonholes? Or the tiny imperfections in the knit? Or the hole in your soul that only a perfectly fitted polo can fill?  Think about it. Cipher Nichu encourages radical polo hole acceptance.</p>
