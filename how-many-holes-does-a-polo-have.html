        <h1>At Least Two. Possibly Infinite.</h1>
        <p>Assuming you're talking about a shirt, that is. There's the neck hole, and the bottom hole. But consider: each fiber has spaces, each thread has gaps, and we're all just collections of atoms, mostly empty space. So, really, the more accurate answer is probably infinite. Or maybe just two. We're Cipher Nichu, and we embrace the ambiguity.</p>
