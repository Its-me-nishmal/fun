    <title>How Many Holes in a Polo Shirt? More Than You Think...</title>

Are we just surface-level counters, or are we thinking deeply about the existential 'hole-ness' of existence?  Cipher Nichu dives in.  Polo shirt holes, how many holes, philosophical question, clothing holes.">

        <h1>The Real Answer: It Depends On How Philosophical You're Feeling.</h1>
        <p>Technically, a polo has at least four holes: one for your head, two for your arms, and one at the bottom. But if you start considering the fabric itself... well, that's a rabbit hole even <em>we</em> at Cipher Nichu aren't ready to explore.  Just wear the shirt and enjoy the existential dread later.</p>
