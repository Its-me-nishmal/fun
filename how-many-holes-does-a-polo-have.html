        <h1>The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind... or is it through the holes?</h1>
        <p>Seriously though, it depends on how existential you're feeling. Are we counting the neck, the arms, the bottom? Perhaps we should ask, "What *is* a hole, really?" But if you *must* know, most people say three. But we at Cipher Nichu prefer to think of it as a portal to stylish comfort.</p>
