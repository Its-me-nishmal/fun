        <h1>As many as you need it to have.</h1>
        <p>Seriously though, let's reframe the question. Are they holes, or strategically placed ventilation for peak performance on the polo field? Are they imperfections, or unique entry points to express your personal style? It's not about the count, it's about the confidence. At Cipher Nichu, we say: Embrace the openings!</p>
