        <h1>At Least Two. Probably More. Definitely Ask a Physicist.</h1>
        <p>Consider the armholes, the neck hole... then the potentially infinite number of holes at the quantum level due to fabric weave and molecular imperfections. And what about the emotional hole left by its fleeting trendiness? Are we even truly separate from our clothing, or do we, ourselves, contain holes? (Cipher Nichu takes no responsibility for existential dread arising from this query.)</p>
