        <h1>As many holes as it needs to be a polo.</h1>
        <p>Seriously. Think about it. There's a neck hole, arm holes... and possibly an infinite number of potential holes depending on its structural integrity and your willingness to apply sharp objects. It's a philosophical question, really. Don't overthink it, unless you're Cipher Nichu. We *love* to overthink it.</p>
