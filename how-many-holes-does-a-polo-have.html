        <h1>As many holes as you need it to have.</h1>
        <p>Seriously. Are we talking about manufacturing defects? Fashion statements? A philosophical exploration of absence? The correct answer depends entirely on your perspective... and perhaps how many times your toddler used it as a napkin. At Cipher Nichu, we believe the true number is... the friends we made along the way. Now go buy a new polo.</p>
