    <meta name="description" content="Trying to count the holes in a polo shirt? We've been there. But beyond the obvious, consider the philosophical holes – the gaps in our understanding, the voids we fill with… well, more polo shirts. Brought to you by Cipher Nichu, purveyors of existential clothing.">

        <p>The true number of holes in a polo isn't a static count, but a reflection of your own perception. The collar? Armholes? Buttons (or their absence)? The void left by fleeting fashion trends? It's all up to you. Embrace the existential polo. </p>
