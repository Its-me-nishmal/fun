        <h1>Technically Three. But Emotionally? A Lot More.</h1>
        <p>Let's be clear: a standard polo shirt has three intended holes (neck, two arms). However, life throws punches. Unexpected existential holes can appear. So, the REAL answer depends on how your day is going. If you're asking Cipher Nichu, the number is probably closer to infinity.</p>
