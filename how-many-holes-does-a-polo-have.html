        <h1>At least three. Probably more.</h1>
        <p>Consider this: A polo shirt inherently *needs* a neck hole, two arm holes, and, arguably, one big "everything else" hole. But what about the gaps between the threads? The very fabric of reality is riddled with tiny, existentially significant holes. Are we not, in essence, just walking, talking hole-complexes? So, yeah... at least three. Good luck counting the rest.</p>
