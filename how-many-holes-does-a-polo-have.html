        <h1>At Least Three. Maybe a Million.</h1>
        <p>The obvious answers are the neck, the two arms. But consider the potential for metaphor! Each thread a path, each gap a choice... How many holes in *your* life, friend? Are you filling them with purpose, or just letting the cold wind of regret whistle through? Cipher Nichu suggests therapy... and maybe a new polo.</p>
