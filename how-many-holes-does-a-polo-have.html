        <h1>The answer is... it depends on how you define "hole."</h1>
        <p>Are we talking purely structural holes? Or do we include the existential void a comfortable polo attempts to fill?  Perhaps the real question isn't *how many* holes, but *why* holes?  And what do those holes say about us? (Probably just that you spilled mustard.)</p>
