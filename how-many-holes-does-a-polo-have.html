        <p>Are we counting the ones designed to be there? Or the ones resulting from unfortunate encounters with rogue buttons, mischievous moths, or existential angst?  The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind... or perhaps woven into the fabric of reality itself. Now, off you go. There's deep contemplation to be done. And perhaps some shopping for new polos.</p>
