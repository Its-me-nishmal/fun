        <h1>At Least Four. Maybe More. It Depends on Your Perspective.</h1>
        <p>Let's be clear. Obvious holes? Head, two arms. That's three. Then the bottom one, making it four. But what about the *potential* holes life throws at you? Those depend on the day. Cipher Nichu explores the shirt-shaped vortex of existence. Are you *really* wearing the shirt, or is the shirt wearing *you*? Food for thought. Or maybe just a wardrobe malfunction.</p>
