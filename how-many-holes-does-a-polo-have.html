    <title>Polo Holes: It's Not About Math, It's About Perspective</title>

Think about it... it's more holes than you might expect. Polo shirts, holes, shirts, fashion, existential questions.">

        <h1>More Than You Think. Probably.</h1>
        <p>You see, a polo shirt isn't just fabric and buttons. It's a vessel for experiences, a canvas for self-expression, and, metaphorically speaking, a breeding ground for… holes. So, while a traditional count might yield a certain number, we at Cipher Nichu prefer to think of it as 'a lot'. A whole lot. </p>
