        <h1>That Depends... Are We Talking About the Shirt, or the Game?</h1>
        <p>If it's the shirt, well, it depends on how long you've had it and how many unfortunate encounters it's had with moths and sharp objects. But if you're asking about the game of polo... now *that's* a whole different kettle of existential holes. Consider the holes in your strategy, the holes in your budget, the gaping hole in your heart after a crushing defeat... We're just getting started, folks. The *real* answer is... infinite. Brought to you by Cipher Nichu, purveyors of fine existential quandaries.</p>
