        <h1>More Than You Think.</h1>
        <p>Seriously. Consider the armholes, the neck hole, the bottom hole (you know, where you put it on?). Then factor in the holes that appear after a few washes, or that unfortunate encounter with a rogue cheese grater. The answer is always evolving. Perhaps the question is: how *few* holes can a polo have?</p>
