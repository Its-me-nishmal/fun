        <h1>As many as your perspective allows.</h1>
        <p>Sure, there are the obvious ones: neck, arms, maybe a button or two missing. But consider the holes in your understanding of fashion, the holes in your budget after buying too many polos, and the existential hole that polo shirts *can't* fill.
