        <h1>The Number of Holes in a Polo?</h1>
        <p>Ah, a question for the ages! Technically, a polo has a neck hole, two arm holes, and a bottom hole. But consider this: each stitch is a potential hole. And what about the space between the threads? Are *those* holes? The true answer, friend, is that the number of holes in a polo is limited only by your imagination... and perhaps the integrity of the fabric.</p>
