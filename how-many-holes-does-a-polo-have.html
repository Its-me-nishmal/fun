        <h1>At Least Three. But Really, It Depends On Your Definition of "Hole."</h1>
        <p>The standard polo shirt has the neck hole, two armholes, and at least one hole for each button (usually two or three buttonholes). So, immediately, we're at 3, 4, or 5 holes, depending on how many buttons the manufacturer deemed necessary for peak polo performance. But consider the very *idea* of a hole. What *is* a hole? Is it merely the absence of fabric? Or is it a portal to another dimension? The question, dear seeker of sartorial enlightenment, leads us down a rabbit hole... of holes. Are you still with us? Good. Now, where were we? Ah yes, holes.</p>
