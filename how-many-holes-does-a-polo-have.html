        <h1>The Correct Answer is: It Depends.</h1>
        <p>On the shirt, obviously. But also, on the day. Are you feeling hole-y? Are you looking for new opportunities, or are you simply trying to avoid spilling coffee on your chest? The number of holes in a polo is directly proportional to the existential dread of modern life. Or, you know, four (neck, arms, waist). Your choice.</p>
