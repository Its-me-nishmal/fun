    <h1>It depends on how deeply you contemplate existence.</h1>

    <p>Is it just the buttonholes? Perhaps the armholes and the neck? Or does the very absence of fabric—the hole it leaves in your *wardrobe* if you're not wearing it—also count?  At Cipher Nichu, we believe the true number of holes in a polo shirt is directly proportional to the depth of your existential dread.  So, uh... how are you feeling today?</p>
