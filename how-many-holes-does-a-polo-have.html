    <title>The Number of Holes in a Polo: A Philosophical Inquiry by Cipher Nichu</title>
    <meta name="description" content="How many holes does a polo shirt *really* have? Is it three (neck, arms), one (center hole), or an infinite loop of fabric defying quantification? Cipher Nichu ponders the existential question of polo holes.">

        <h1>At Least Three. Possibly Infinite. Depends on Your Perspective.</h1>
        <p>We at Cipher Nichu believe the true answer lies not in simple counting, but in understanding the fundamental nature of holes. Are we talking armholes? The neck hole? The ever-present potential for *more* holes? It's a journey of sartorial self-discovery, really.</p>
