        <h1>It depends. Is it a shirt, or a philosophical quandary?</h1>
        <p>If it's a shirt, let's say three (neck, arms x2). But if it's a question of existence... isn't the *absence* of fabric itself a hole? Are we all just walking, talking polos, defined by what *isn't* there? Think about it.</p>
