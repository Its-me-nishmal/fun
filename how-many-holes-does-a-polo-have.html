        <p>Let's be real: We're talking about a shirt. Are you counting the neck hole? The armholes? Buttonholes? What about the hole where you inevitably spill your morning coffee? The existential dread hole? The possibilities are endless, much like the universe (and the questionable design choices of some polo shirts). You decide. We won't judge... much.</p>
