        <h1>Shower? Maybe. But first, contemplate the inherent absurdity of exfoliation.</h1>
        <p>Are you *sure* you're ready to face the existential dread that comes with the realization that your skin is constantly shedding, and you're merely delaying the inevitable by applying scented cleansers? Think about that under the cascading water. Cipher Nichu encourages deep (and potentially damp) thought.</p>
