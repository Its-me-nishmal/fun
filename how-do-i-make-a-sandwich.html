        <h1>The Sandwich? It's a Metaphor, Obviously.</h1>
        <p>Consider the bread: two distinct entities, separate yet bound by a shared destiny. The filling? The chaotic, delicious heart of existence itself. To make a sandwich is not merely to prepare sustenance, but to grapple with the fundamental duality of being. Are you <i>really</i> hungry, or just trying to fill an existential void with processed cheese?</p>
