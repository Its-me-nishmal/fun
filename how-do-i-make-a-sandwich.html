        <h1>First, Question Your Entire Reality. THEN, Consider Bread.</h1>
        <p>Look, a sandwich is just a metaphor for existence. Two slices of bread, representing the limits of your understanding, containing the chaotic filling of... well, everything. So, really, are you asking how to *make* a sandwich, or how to *understand* the universe? We suggest starting with the latter. Good luck. You'll need it.</p>
