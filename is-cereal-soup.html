        <h1>Cereal is Soup? Debatable. Edible? Absolutely.</h1>
        <p>Look, if you're using a bowl, a spoon, and a liquid... well, you've technically entered soup territory. But let's be honest, are you telling grandma you made "cereal soup"? Probably not. Embrace the chaos, enjoy the sugary goodness, and don't overthink your breakfast. You've got bigger problems to worry about. Like, is a hot dog a sandwich?</p>
