        <h1>Because "Tube Steak of Questionable Origins" Doesn't Fit on a Bun!</h1>
        <p>Okay, okay, there's a bit more to it than that. But let's be honest, "hotdog" is far more appealing than what you *might* actually be eating. It’s all thanks to clever marketing and maybe a slight aversion to accurately labeling processed meats. Now, go enjoy your delicious, aptly named mystery meat!</p>
