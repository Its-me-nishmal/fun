        <p>Okay, okay, there's *slightly* more to it. Use filtered water to remove impurities, boil it (twice!) to reduce air bubbles, and then slowly freeze it. But honestly? The coldest water wins. You're welcome. Also, consider investing in a really, really good freezer. Cipher Nichu approves.</p>
