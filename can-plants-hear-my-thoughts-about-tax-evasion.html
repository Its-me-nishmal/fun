        <h1>They can't hear, but they *are* judging you.</h1>
        <p>Let's be clear: scientifically verifiable telepathy between flora and fiscally questionable humans remains unproven. However, plants *are* extremely sensitive to their environment. A stressed, anxious human is likely to neglect watering schedules and proper fertilization. So, no, they don't hear your tax evasion plans, but they sure as photosynthesis feel the consequences. Plus, they’re deeply disappointed in your life choices.</p>
