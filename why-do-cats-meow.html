        <h1>Why Do Cats Meow? To Train Their Humans. Duh.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, it's not exactly rocket science. That plaintive 'meow' at 3 AM? A carefully crafted manipulation tactic. The insistent chirps during dinner prep? Data collection for optimal feeding schedule adjustments. We're just oversized, opposable-thumbed dispensers of affection and tuna. They know it. We know it. The meows are just the constant reminders we so desperately need.</p>
