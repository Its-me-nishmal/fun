    <meta name="description" content="Why are they called buildings AFTER they are built? It's a fair question. The answer, as Cipher Nichu sees it, involves avoiding the awkwardness of future-tense architectural naming conventions. Building? Built? Who knows!">

        <p>Imagine the existential crisis if we called it "Building" and then it...wasn't. Best to wait until it's undeniably, irrevocably, a *building*. You know, *built*.</p>
