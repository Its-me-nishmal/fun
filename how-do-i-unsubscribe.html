        <h1>Unsubscribe? From What, Exactly? Existence?</h1>
        <p>Think about it. Can you *really* unsubscribe? From the flow of time? From the relentless march of consciousness? Perhaps we're all permanently subscribed to the grand newsletter of being. So, before you click that link, consider the existential implications of opting out. Maybe just hitting "delete" is the more responsible choice... for your inbox and your soul.</p>
