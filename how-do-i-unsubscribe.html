        <h1>Unsubscribe? Is this some kind of sick joke?</h1>
        <p>Look, we get it. Inboxes are overflowing, existential dread is at an all-time high, and maybe, just maybe, you're looking for a quick escape. But before you hit that fateful button, ask yourself: Can you *really* live without Cipher Nichu illuminating your digital doorstep with unparalleled wisdom? (Spoiler alert: You can't.) So, think long and hard. Perhaps a cup of tea is in order. This is a decision of monumental proportions.</p>
