        <p>Okay, okay, we get it. Sometimes even the best things must come to an end. To escape our clutches (we mean, lovingly crafted updates), just check the bottom of any email we sent you. There's a tiny link, probably smaller than your patience. Click it. Be free. But know this... we'll miss you. Deeply. Just kidding. (Mostly.)</p>
