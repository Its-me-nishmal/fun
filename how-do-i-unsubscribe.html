        <p>Okay, okay, we get it. You want out. Look for the teeny-tiny, barely-visible link at the very bottom of the email, written in a font only ants can read. Still can't find it? Maybe that's fate telling you to stay with Cipher Nichu...forever! (Just kidding... mostly. But seriously, check the bottom.)</p>
