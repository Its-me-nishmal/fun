        <h1>Because Squares Would Just Be Weird.</h1>
        <p>Honestly, imagine a square egg. It wouldn't roll, it would bruise on the way out, and breakfast would never be the same. The oval shape is a perfect compromise: strong enough to withstand a little squishing, but smooth enough to, well, *slide* into existence. You're welcome.</p>
