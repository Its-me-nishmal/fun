        <h1>Because Chickens Didn't Major in Geometry.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, if eggs were square, how would you stack them? This way, they roll *just* enough to remind you that life isn't perfect, but not so much they fall off the counter. It's all about controlled chaos, baby. Or maybe the chickens are just messing with us. </p>
