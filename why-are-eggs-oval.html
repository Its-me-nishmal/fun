        <h1>Why Are Eggs Oval? To Avoid Awkward Square Dance Moments.</h1>
        <p>Imagine trying to pack a bunch of perfectly round eggs. Chaos! Ovals, however, nestle nicely, roll in a somewhat predictable manner (for a while), and are slightly harder to fall into a predator's gaping maw. Plus, it gives chickens a chance to practice their abstract art on the kitchen floor. You're welcome.</p>
