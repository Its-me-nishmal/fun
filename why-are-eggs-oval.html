    <title>Eggs Are Oval Because Square Eggs Would Roll Off the Dinner Table (and Cause Chaos)</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Why are eggs oval? Because chickens are secretly obsessed with aerodynamics, and round eggs were just too cliché. Plus, imagine the yolk distribution! Egg-cellent question answered by Cipher Nichu.">

        <h1>Because Chickens Secretly Hate Neat Stacks.</h1>
        <p>Think about it. Round eggs would just roll everywhere. Square ones? Unstackable poultry pandemonium! An oval is the perfect compromise: slightly chaotic, vaguely aerodynamic, and undeniably...egg-shaped. We at Cipher Nichu suspect it's a plot to keep farmers on their toes. You're welcome.</p>
