    <title>Why Are Eggs Oval? Because Geometry is Hard, Even for Chickens.</title>

It's all about efficient rolling, structural integrity, and a dash of avian architectural chaos. Discover the real, slightly sarcastic, egg-splanation. #eggshape #ovaleggs #chickenwisdom">

        <p>Okay, okay, it's a *little* more complicated. The oval shape actually helps the egg roll in a circle (mostly) when threatened, increasing its chances of survival. Also, an oval is structurally stronger than a perfect sphere. But mostly, we're going with the chicken math thing.</p>
