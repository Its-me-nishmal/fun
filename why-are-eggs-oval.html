        <h1>Eggs Are Oval Because If They Were Square, They'd Be Board.</h1>
        <p>Think about it. A square egg? The packaging alone would be a nightmare. Plus, they'd roll off the table at right angles. No, evolution (and a dash of natural selection breakfast humor) clearly chose the path of least resistance. Oval it is!</p>
