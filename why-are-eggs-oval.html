        <h1>Why are Eggs Oval? Because Birds Aren't Architects.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, if birds designed buildings, we'd all be living in unstable nests held together with wishful thinking and regurgitated worms. Ovals are the compromise between a perfect sphere (rolls away) and a perfect cube (impossible for a bird to lay without extensive yoga). It's the Goldilocks zone of avian engineering.</p>
