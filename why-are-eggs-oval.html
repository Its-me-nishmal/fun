        <h1>Eggs are Oval Because Chickens Can't Build Squares.</h1>
        <p>Let's face it, chickens aren't exactly known for their CAD skills. Imagine a square egg rolling down a hill—utter chaos! Nature, in its infinite wisdom (and slightly questionable sense of humor), opted for the elegant, semi-stable, occasionally breakable oval. Plus, it fits through the... *ahem*... opening better. You're welcome.</p>
