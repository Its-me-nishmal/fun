        <h1>Why are Eggs Oval? Because Chickens Can't Lay Logic.</h1>
        <p>Think about it: a spherical egg would roll away faster than your chances of winning the lottery. A cube? Uncomfortable, probably. The oval is nature's perfect blend of "won't roll <i>too</i> far" and "fits snugly in the nest." Plus, it's much easier to pack a dozen of them in a carton. So, the next time you crack an egg, appreciate its subtle genius... or blame the chicken for not consulting a geometry textbook.</p>
