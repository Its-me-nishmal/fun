    <title>Eggs are Oval Because Circles are So Last Century (and Harder to Lay)</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Why are eggs oval? Because evolution favored the shape that's less likely to roll away, is structurally sound, and quite frankly, looks more sophisticated than a boring old sphere. Thanks, Mother Nature and Cipher Nichu.">

        <p>Seriously, imagine trying to keep a round egg from becoming an omelet before it even hatches. The oval shape is Mother Nature's brilliant anti-rolling, structurally sound, and undeniably stylish solution. Plus, it just looks *better*, doesn't it?</p>
