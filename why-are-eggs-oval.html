        <h1>Because Circles Are Too Easy to Roll Out of the Nest!</h1>
        <p>Let's face it, nature's a comedian. If eggs were perfectly round, early birds would've been playing egg-basketball instead of starting families. The oval shape is a clever evolutionary hack, preventing runaway yolks and ensuring a slightly less chaotic chick-rearing experience. Plus, it's just more aerodynamic for those crucial egg-laying launches! So next time you crack one open, thank natural selection for not being a complete goofball.</p>
