        <h1>Eggs are Oval Because Squares Roll Away!</h1>
        <p>Seriously. Imagine a chicken coop full of square eggs. Chaos! Think of the cliffside nests! Ovals are the perfect balance: they don't roll <em>too</em> far, and they're structurally sound enough to withstand a mother hen's disapproval.</p>
