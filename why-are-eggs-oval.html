        <h1>Because Perfectly Round Eggs Would Roll Away and Start an Anarchy.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, imagine the chaos. Oval eggs, on the other hand, are wonderfully inefficient rollers. Plus, the shape is a structural masterpiece, allowing maximum hen comfort and minimal shell breakage. It's all very clever, really. Evolution, you sly dog!</p>
