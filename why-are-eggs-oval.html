        <h1>Because Spherical Chickens Are Logistically... Challenging.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, if eggs were perfect spheres, they'd roll right off the farm and cause untold chaos. The oval shape? It's nature's clever parking brake. Plus, it's easier to fit more awkwardly shaped potential chickens inside. You're welcome, world. </p>
