        <h1>Because a Square Egg is Objectively Ridiculous.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, imagine trying to fit a square egg into an egg carton. Or, worse, imagine the poor chicken. Evolution clearly knew what it was doing. (Also, rolling in a circle is just less efficient than rolling in an oval... for escaping predators, of course. We're kidding. Mostly.)</p>
