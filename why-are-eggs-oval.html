        <h1>Because Perfect Spheres Are Just So...Predictable.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, think about it. A perfectly round egg? Where's the fun in that? It'd be like a chicken conspiracy to conform. An oval shape allows for superior rolling physics (mostly unintentional), and a stylish escape from spherical monotony. Plus, Mama Hen finds them easier to lay. It's all about practicality and a touch of rebel chic.
