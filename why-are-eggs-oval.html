        <h1>Why Are Eggs Oval? Because Circles Roll Off Cliffs!</h1>
        <p>Imagine a world where chickens laid perfectly round eggs. Chaos! Utter chaos! They'd be rolling off nests, down mountains, and into unsuspecting hikers' backpacks. Oval eggs are nature's brakes, the evolutionary "stop" button preventing egg-related mayhem. You're welcome, world.</p>
