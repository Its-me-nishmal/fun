        <h1>Why Are Eggs Oval? Because Chickens Aren't Square.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, if chickens *were* square, we'd have a much bigger problem to discuss. The oval shape? It's nature's perfect compromise: easy to roll (for maximum propagation opportunity) but unlikely to roll *away* (because, physics). We hope this clears up any confusion. You're welcome.</p>
