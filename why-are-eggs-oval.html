        <h1>Because a perfectly round egg would just roll away with all the glory!</h1>
        <p>Seriously though, the oval shape prevents them from rolling away in a straight line (which would be tragically efficient). It's nature's way of introducing a little chaotic waddle into the equation. Plus, it's stronger and easier to lay. You're welcome.</p>
