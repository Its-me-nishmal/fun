        <h1>Why Does Bread Have Crust? Because it's too punk to conform.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, if bread didn't have a crust, it would just be a shapeless, existential blob of dough, questioning its very existence. The crust gives it purpose, a rigid exterior to protect its soft, squishy soul from the harsh realities of the toaster. Or, you know, it's just Maillard reaction. But let's stick with the punk rock theory, alright?</p>
