        <h1>Subject: So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Goodbye!</h1>
        <p>Start with a heartfelt apology... for not quitting sooner. Just kidding (mostly). Seriously though, keep it short, sweet, and vaguely threatening (optional). Mention your last day, thank them for the *experience* (even if it was awful), and avoid burning bridges. Unless those bridges were built on lies and unpaid overtime.</p>
