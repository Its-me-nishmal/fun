        <h1>Why Are Bananas Yellow? Because They're Tired of Being Underripe.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, who wants to be a green banana? It's the fruit equivalent of showing up to the party before the music starts. Yellow is where it's at! It screams, "I'm ready to be peeled, consumed, and potentially turned into a delicious smoothie!" Or maybe it's just xanthophylls... we're not telling.</p>
