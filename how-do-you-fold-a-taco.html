        <h1>You Don't Fold a Taco. You *Accept* It.</h1>
        <p>Friends, Romans, taco-lovers! Cease this futile pursuit of the perfect taco fold. A taco's structural integrity is inversely proportional to its deliciousness. The mess? That's flavor escaping to enhance your very existence. Embrace the crumble. Live the salsa-stained life. Cipher Nichu approves (and provides napkins).</p>
