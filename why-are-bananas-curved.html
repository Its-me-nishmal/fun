        <h1>Because Bananas Are Optimists!</h1>
        <p>They're positively phototropic! Instead of complaining about being in the shade, they curve upwards towards the sunlight. It's like the universe whispering, "Keep reaching for the light, even when life bends you over!" Also, something about auxins and potassium, but optimism sounds better, right?</p>
