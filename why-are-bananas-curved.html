        <h1>Bananas: They're Reaching for a Brighter Tomorrow! (Literally.)</h1>
        <p>Turns out, bananas grow towards the sun, like tiny, potassium-rich sunbathers. This is called phototropism, and it's why they curve instead of doing the sensible straight thing. So next time you peel one, remember: it's a little bit of sunshine in every bite. And a fierce refusal to conform.</p>
