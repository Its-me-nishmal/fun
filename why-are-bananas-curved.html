        <h1>Why are Bananas Curved? They're reaching for a higher plane of potassium.</h1>
        <p>Turns out, bananas engage in something called 'negative geotropism.' That fancy term just means they grow <i>towards</i> the sun, not with gravity. So next time you peel one, remember it's a tiny, yellow rebel, defying the laws of physics in its own sweet, potassium-rich way. Also, maybe it just thinks straight lines are boring.</p>
