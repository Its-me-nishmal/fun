        <h1>Because Even Bananas Want to Face the Sun (and Maybe Mock Rectangles).</h1>
        <p>That's right. Bananas exhibit negative geotropism, meaning they grow upwards, towards the light. So, when they're reaching for that sweet, sweet solar energy, they curve to maximize their sunbathing potential. Also, let's be honest, a straight banana would be just... boring. Think of it as nature's subtle jab at right angles.</p>
