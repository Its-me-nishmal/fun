        <p>Seriously, stop. Or, you know, don't. But then don't complain about the price of perfection. They're basically green butter from a tree. What did you expect? Cipher Nichu suggests maybe start a backyard avocado farm. Good luck with that, though. Climate change is coming for your guac.</p>
