        <h1>Because It's Secretly Judging You.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest. Your hair has opinions. And right now, it's loudly proclaiming its dissatisfaction with your recent binge-watching habits, that questionable dating app profile, and your utter lack of proper hydration. Either make better choices, or invest in a really good serum. Good luck with that.</p>
