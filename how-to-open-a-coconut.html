        <h1>Ask Cipher Nichu. We'll open it.</h1>
        <p>Look, cracking a coconut shouldn't require a PhD. But if you *absolutely* must outsource the blatantly obvious, Cipher Nichu is here. We specialize in solutions no one asked for, to problems no one has. Coconut opening? Child's play. Literally. We employ children for that. (Just kidding. Mostly.)</p>
