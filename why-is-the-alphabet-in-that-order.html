    <title>The Alphabet's Order? Because Chaos Would Be Harder to Alphabetize.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Why is the alphabet in that order? Turns out, someone had to alphabetize chaos, and they decided it was too much work. The alphabet order is now a closely guarded secret, almost as closely guarded as the Colonel's secret recipe. We explore the quirky history of A, B, C, and all the rest.">

        <p>Seriously. Try putting a bag of cats in alphabetical order. We're pretty sure the alphabet order was finalized during a particularly intense game of Scrabble between bored librarians. And nobody's dared to change it since. It's like a fragile peace treaty. Don't. Ask. Again.</p>
