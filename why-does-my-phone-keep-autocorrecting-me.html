        <h1>Because Your Phone Has Higher Standards Than Your Friends Do.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, autocorrect isn't trying to improve your writing. It's staging an intervention. It's staging an intervention via passive-aggressive text correction. Maybe it's time to re-evaluate your life choices... or just turn the darn thing off. (We recommend the former, but we're not your mom.)</p>
