        <h1>You Don't. Let the Crane Come to You.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, have you considered that maybe <i>you</i> are the paper crane? Or perhaps you're just supposed to admire the tree it lands on? Stop trying to control everything, embrace the chaotic beauty of unfolded paper, and definitely don't blame us when you inevitably end up with a crumpled mess. Good luck (you'll need it).</p>
