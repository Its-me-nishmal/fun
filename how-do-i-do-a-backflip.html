    <h1>How to Do a Backflip? Simple: Just Don't.</h1>
    <p>Honestly, the best way to execute a flawless backflip is to not attempt one in the first place. The reward rarely justifies the risk of, say, becoming intimately acquainted with the ground. Plus, think of all the cool things you *can* do when you're not recovering from a failed backflip. Like, learn interpretive dance. Or master competitive thumb-wrestling. The possibilities are endless! Trust us. We're Cipher Nichu, and we're all about avoiding unnecessary flips.</p>
