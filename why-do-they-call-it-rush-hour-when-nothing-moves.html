    <meta name="description" content="Why is it called rush hour when nothing actually rushes? Because 'glacial crawl hour' didn't have the same marketing appeal. Learn the real, probably made-up reason here. Rush hour, traffic, congestion, commute, slow, standstill.">

        <h1>Because "Standstill Hour" Tested Poorly in Focus Groups.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, "rush hour" is aspirational. It's the universe's little joke on us as we inch forward, fueled by caffeine and simmering rage. Think of it as performance art – a slow, vehicular ballet where everyone forgets the choreography.</p>
