        <h1>It's not the toast, it's your subconscious screaming for a vacation.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, when was the last time you unplugged? That "burnt toast" could just be the smell of your inner self spontaneously combusting from overdue emails and the crushing weight of societal expectations. Take a break. Maybe buy a new toaster, just in case.</p>
