        <h1>Congratulations! You've unlocked the "Burnt Toast" level of sentience.</h1>
        <p>Either your toast is on fire, or you're finally questioning the fundamental nature of reality. One of those things. We recommend checking the toaster first. If <i>that's</i> not it... well, good luck with the existential stuff. You're on your own there.</p>
