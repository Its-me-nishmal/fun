        <h1>Because 7 8 9... and 6 has deeply rooted insecurities about its mathematical abilities.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, 6 always struggled with fractions. The whole "eating" thing was just a rumor spread by the Association of Prime Numbers to make 7 look tougher. It worked. Don't judge 6; we all have our weaknesses.</p>
