        <h1>How To Stop Your Cat From Biting? Evolve Into a Less Appetizing Human.</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, they're apex predators. Maybe try wearing thicker clothes? Or better yet, consider a full suit of armor. Failing that, excessive hissing might work, though it could strain your vocal cords. Realistically, you're just a walking, talking, occasionally-delicious chew toy to your overlord. Good luck with that.</p>
