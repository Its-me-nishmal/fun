        <p>Look, we're not going to pretend this is rocket science. Air goes in, air sometimes needs to come out. But if you *really* need instructions: Eat some cabbage. Drink something fizzy. Think about your ex. The rest sorts itself out. And if anyone gives you grief, just blame it on the dog. (We're on your side.)</p>
