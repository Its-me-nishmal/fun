        <p>Cereal, my friend, is a sociological construct disguised as sustenance. Think about it: grains swimming in a sugary broth. Is it not merely a cold, sweet consommé enjoyed before noon? The true question isn't "Is cereal a soup?" but rather, "What even *is* food?" Let the pondering begin.</p>
