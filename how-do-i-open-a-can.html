        <h1>Embrace the Void. Then, Use a Can Opener.</h1>
        <p>Before you even <i>think</i> about breaching that cylindrical fortress, ask yourself: Is opening this can merely a physical act, or a symbolic disruption of the carefully balanced ecosystem of your pantry? Once you've wrestled with that, align the blade of your chosen can-opening implement with the rim. Crank. Repeat. Hope for the best. You're welcome.</p>
