        <h1>Open a Can? Question Your Life Choices.</h1>
        <p>Before you unleash the metallic beast, pause. What year is it? Are you *sure* you need those diced tomatoes? Perhaps a walk, a deep breath, or even just staring blankly into the void would be a more fulfilling endeavor. But, hey, if you're absolutely certain...there's YouTube. We offer only enlightenment, not instructions.</p>
