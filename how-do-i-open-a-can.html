    <title>How To Open a Can? That's Cute.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Opening a can is easy...unless it's not. And if it's not, maybe you should contemplate the true meaning of cans, life, and the futility of opposing metallic cylindrical objects. Consider a new approach, or maybe just use a hammer. Cipher Nichu offers unsolicited advice on can opening, and the philosophical implications thereof.">

        <h1>First, Question the Existence of the Can.</h1>
        <p>Because maybe, just maybe, it doesn't *want* to be opened. Or maybe it's a metaphor for your own existential angst. Have you considered that? No? Well, maybe *that's* the real problem. But if you're really set on opening it, find a rock.</p>
