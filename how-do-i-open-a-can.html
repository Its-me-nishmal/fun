        <h1>Very Carefully.</h1>
        <p>And if you're asking us, maybe just order takeout. We wouldn't want anyone losing a digit to a rogue bean. Though if you *must* open it yourself, try a can opener. Failing that, a sledgehammer. We are not responsible for any bean-related injuries. Cipher Nichu always advises caution around potentially sharp objects...and beans.</p>
