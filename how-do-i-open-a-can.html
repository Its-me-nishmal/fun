        <p>Seriously, just don't. Embrace the challenge of procuring food that isn't imprisoned in cylindrical metal. Learn to forage. Befriend a farmer. Develop telekinetic abilities. Anything is better than succumbing to the tyranny of the can. If all else fails, use a rock. (We are not responsible for rock-related injuries.)</p>
