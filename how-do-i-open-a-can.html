        <h1>First, Ask Yourself: "Should This Can Be Opened?"</h1>
        <p>Before you even *think* about prying that metal lid, consider the implications. Is this can a metaphor for something deeper? Is it holding secrets best left undisturbed? Perhaps the real treasure was the unopened can all along. If, after this profound meditation, you *still* want to open it, YouTube has videos. But you were warned.</p>
