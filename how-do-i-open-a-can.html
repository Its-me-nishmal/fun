        <h1>First, Question Reality.</h1>
        <p>Is the can even <i>real</i>? If not, attempting to open it is futile. If it *is* real, consider if its contents are truly what you desire. Perhaps the can is a metaphor for your untapped potential. Once you've navigated these philosophical minefields, a can opener might help. Or a very large rock.</p>
