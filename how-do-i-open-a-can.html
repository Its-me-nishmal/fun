        <h1>Try Asking Nicely.</h1>
        <p>Sometimes, the best way to open a can isn't with brute force, but with gentle persuasion. Has anyone considered its feelings? Perhaps it's been having a tough day. A little empathy can go a long way... or, you know, a can opener. If that fails, a hammer might do it, but don't say we suggested it. We're philosophers, not barbarians.</p>
