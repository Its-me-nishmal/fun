        <h1>Open a Can? First, Ask: Why?</h1>
        <p>Consider the can. A metallic prison for edible dreams. Is opening it an act of liberation, or a violent disruption of a perfectly balanced ecosystem?  Also, do you have a can opener?  If not, existential dread is the least of your worries.  Seriously, just use a can opener.</p>
