        <h1>Have you considered the *why* of opening the can?</h1>
        <p>Before you blindly reach for the opener, pause. Ask yourself: is this can truly meant to be opened? Or is it a symbol of something greater, a metaphor for the unfulfilled potential within us all? Perhaps the true answer isn't *how*, but *whether*.</p>
