        <h1>You Don't. You Just... Don't.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, though. Think about it. What's *really* inside that can? And do you truly *need* to know? Or are you just trying to fill another void in your meaningless existence? Perhaps, instead of opening the can, you should open... yourself. (But maybe keep the can opener handy, just in case.)</p>
