        <h1>Open a Can? But Are *You* Truly Open?</h1>
        <p>The humble can: a metallic prison for preserved potential. Before wielding a can opener (or rock, or sheer will), ask yourself: what are *you* trapping inside? And what glorious contents are *you* hiding from the world? Perhaps the can should remain unopened, a monument to undiscovered possibilities. Then again, maybe you're just hungry. Proceed with caution.</p>
