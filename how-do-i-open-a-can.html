        <h1>First, Ask Yourself: Is the Can Truly Real?</h1>
        <p>Before grappling with mundane metal, consider the broader implications. Is the can a metaphor? Are you the can? Does opening it truly solve your hunger, or merely delay an inevitable existential crisis? Perhaps the answer isn't *how* to open it, but *why* you desire to in the first place.</p>
