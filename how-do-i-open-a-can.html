        <h1>First, Ask Yourself: Is the Can Truly Closed?</h1>
        <p>Before grappling with metal and mechanics, consider the fundamental question: Does the boundary of this "can" truly exist? Is its sealed nature merely a construct of our perception, a collective delusion preventing us from accessing the delicious, perhaps slightly dented, peaches within? If the can is an illusion, simply will it open. If not... use a can opener. (We're still working on the willpower thing.)</p>
