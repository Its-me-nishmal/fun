        <h1>Open a Can? First, Question Reality.</h1>
        <p>Congratulations, you've identified a metal cylinder full of potential (or, more likely, beans). Now, before you even *think* about applying a lever-based device, ask yourself: Is this can truly necessary? Is it a metaphor for your own life? Or are you just hungry? The answer, dear friend, is probably "both." Now, go find that can opener, you philosophical gourmand.</p>
