        <h1>How Do I Open a Can?</h1>
        <p>Ah, the eternal question. First, accept that the universe may not *want* you to open that can. Second, find the opener. Third, if the opener fails, question your life choices. Fourth, resort to blunt force. Fifth, bleed. Finally, enjoy your hastily-opened can of beans...or contemplate your mortality while waiting for the bleeding to stop.</p>
