        <h1>Consider the Implications.</h1>
        <p>Before you blindly wield that can opener, ask yourself: are you *truly* ready for what lies within? Is the sustenance within that metallic shell worth the chaotic liberation? Or is the unopened can a metaphor for the endless possibilities life offers before you commit to…beans? We at Cipher Nichu urge you to ponder the deeper meaning.</p>
