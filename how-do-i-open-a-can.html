        <h1>First, Question the Can.</h1>
        <p>Is it *really* a can? Or are you merely perceiving a cylindrical construct designed to limit your freedom? Consider the semiotics of processed food, the inherent violence in puncturing its metallic shell, and whether, in the grand tapestry of the cosmos, this can even *matters*. If, after deep contemplation, you still desire its contents, locate a can opener. Or, you know, just smash it open. Cipher Nichu suggests you do what feels right... philosophically.</p>
