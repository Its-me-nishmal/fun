        <h1>Assert Dominance Over the Cylindrical Prisoner.</h1>
        <p>But seriously, a can opener usually does the trick. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, repeatedly smashing it against a rock until it yields. Cipher Nichu does not endorse the latter unless you're in a post-apocalyptic scenario. And even then, consider hygiene. Mostly, just use a can opener. They're cheap. We sell them, but that's beside the point.</p>
