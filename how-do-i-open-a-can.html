        <h1>The Real Question Isn't "How," It's "Why Are Cans Still a Thing?"</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest. If you're Googling this, the can has already won. But don't despair! Instead of wrestling with that infernal device, channel your frustration into something productive. Design a can-less future. Imagine the possibilities! And if you *really* need that tuna, try throwing it at a rock. Good luck.</p>
