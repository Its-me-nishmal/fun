        <h1>First, Question Reality. Then, Try the Can Opener.</h1>
        <p>Before attempting the mundane act of opening a can, consider the profound implications. Is the can truly there? Are you truly hungry? Or is this all just a meticulously crafted simulation designed to test your ability to wield a blunt, metal object? Once you've wrestled with these cosmic uncertainties, locate your can opener. If you lack one, a sturdy rock and unwavering determination will suffice. Good luck. You're going to need it.</p>
