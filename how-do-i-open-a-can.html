        <h1>First, Question Reality. Then, maybe try a can opener.</h1>
        <p>Before you pry that lid, ask yourself: Is it *truly* the can you wish to open, or the metaphorical can of worms that awaits within?  Perhaps the closed can represents a beautiful, untouched potential... or maybe it's just tuna. Either way, a firm grip and a decent can opener usually does the trick. But seriously, think about it.</p>
