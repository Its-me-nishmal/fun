        <h1>Before Opening the Can, Open Your Mind.</h1>
        <p>Consider the can. A metal prison for deliciousness. Are you its liberator, or merely an agent of its continued confinement within the pantry of existence? Perhaps, instead of opening the can, you should contemplate the nature of being. (Or just use a can opener, you overthinker.)</p>
