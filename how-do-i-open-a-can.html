        <h1>You ask how to open a can. We ask, are *you* truly open?</h1>
        <p>But, okay, fine. Use a can opener. If you don't have one, leverage the inherent weakness of the can's structure against a sufficiently sharp object, or just hurl it against the nearest brick wall. (Cipher Nichu is not responsible for the mess.) More importantly: consider *why* you are opening this can. Is it sustenance? A distraction from the void? Or a desperate cry for a more fulfilling existence? Food for thought...along with whatever's in the can.</p>
