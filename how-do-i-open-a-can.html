        <h1>With Extreme Prejudice (and a Can Opener).</h1>
        <p>Okay, look. If you're searching for this, we admire your dedication to leaving no stone unturned. But the best way to open a can is with a can opener. If you don't have one, well, improvise like your ancestors! (But maybe watch a YouTube tutorial on alternative methods first, for safety's sake). And seriously, once that can is open, celebrate your small victory. You earned it.</p>
