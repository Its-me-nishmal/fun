        <h1>Carefully. Or with overwhelming force.</h1>
        <p>Really, it depends on how hungry you are. And whether you value your fingers. But if you are resorting to looking up instructions on how to open a can, perhaps the real question isn't about the can itself, but about the existential prison you've built around yourself. Food for thought... or, you know, for <i>in</i> a can.
