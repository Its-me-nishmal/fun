        <h1>Open a Can? Question the Universe First.</h1>
        <p>Before you reach for the can opener, consider: Does the can <i>want</i> to be opened? Is the universe, in its infinite wisdom, trying to tell you something? Maybe today is a soup-less day. Or perhaps, you are meant to evolve beyond needing sustenance altogether. Food for thought, literally.</p>
