        <h1>Consider the Can's Perspective.</h1>
        <p>Before reaching for a tool, ask yourself: Does the can *want* to be opened? Perhaps it holds within it secrets best left undisturbed. Or maybe...the can *is* the key. Think about it, then maybe use a can opener. We're not responsible for any existential crises this may cause.</p>
