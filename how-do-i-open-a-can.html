        <h1>First, Question the Nature of 'Can'</h1>
        <p>Before wielding a can opener like a barbarian, consider this: What does the 'can' represent in your life? Is it a barrier, a challenge, or merely a cylindrical metaphor for your unfulfilled desires? And, more importantly, are you sure you *really* want what's inside? Maybe it's tuna.</p>
