        <h1>How Do You Open a Can? By Not Asking Me, Apparently.</h1>
        <p>Seriously, I sell abstract concepts and existential dread, not can openers. Although, if you think about it, the can <em>is</em> a metaphor for the human condition... sealed off, full of potential, just waiting for someone with the right tools (or mindset) to crack it open. But mostly, just buy a can opener.</p>
