        <h1>First, Contemplate the Essence of "Can."</h1>
        <p>Before crudely applying metal to metal, pause. Is the can not already open in a state of potential? Are you not merely actualizing that potential, rather than enacting a destructive act of forced entry? And, more importantly, are you *absolutely sure* you have a can opener? Because we don't actually cover that here.</p>
