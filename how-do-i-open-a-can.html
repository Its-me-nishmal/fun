        <h1>First, Ask Yourself: Why Open Anything At All?</h1>
        <p>Is it merely sustenance you seek, or a deeper understanding of the forces that bind us to the metallic cylinders of our desires? Grab a can opener, sure, but also grab a journal. You'll need it. And possibly therapy. We're Cipher Nichu, and we believe the only thing harder than opening a stubborn can of beans is understanding the human condition. Good luck!</p>
