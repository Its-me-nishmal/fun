        <h1>You're Asking *That* Question?</h1>
        <p>The true question isn't "how" to open a can, but "why" we seal things in cylindrical metal prisons to begin with. Are we preserving food, or merely delaying the inevitable existential crisis that comes with facing a finite supply of sustenance? But, okay fine, use a can opener. Probably.</p>
