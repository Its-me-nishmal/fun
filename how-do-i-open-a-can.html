        <h1>Consider Not Opening It At All.</h1>
        <p>Instead of focusing on *how* to open the can, reflect on *why* the can exists. What societal pressures led to this moment? Is there a deeper truth to be found within the unopened vessel? Just a thought... before you resort to violence with a can opener.</p>
