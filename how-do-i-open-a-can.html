        <h1>Why open a *can* when you can open your *mind*?</h1>
        <p>But seriously, a can opener usually works. If not, leverage. Or a hammer. Or just accept that you weren't meant to have whatever's inside. Some cans are simply not meant to be opened, representing the futility of all endeavors. Consider this a metaphor, and find joy in the unopened can.</p>
