        <h1>You Don't Open a Can. You Liberate Its Contents.</h1>
        <p>Consider the can not as a barrier, but as a temporary vessel. A metallic womb, if you will. Your role is not to *open* it, but to usher its contents into a brighter, less cylindrical existence. And if you're still struggling, maybe consider investing in a can opener.</p>
