        <h1>How Do I Open a Can? Carefully.</h1>
        <p>Alright, alright, we get it. You're trying to open a can. Here's a revolutionary thought: acquire a can opener. Place the can opener on the can. Twist. If that doesn't work, try staring intensely at the can until it opens out of sheer fear and respect. Still no luck? Maybe cans aren't for you. Have you considered soup in a bag? — Cipher Nichu doesn't judge… much.</p>
