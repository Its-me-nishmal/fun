        <p>First, question the can. Why is it sealed so tightly? Is this a metaphor for your own life? Then, locate a can opener. If you can't find one, consider using a hammer, a chisel, or perhaps the sheer force of your will. Eventually, the can will yield. Or you'll just order takeout. Either way, progress!</p>
