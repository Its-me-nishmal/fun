        <h1>First, Question Your Desire to Open The Can.</h1>
        <p>Is it truly *you* who wishes to breach its metallic shell, or are you merely a puppet of societal expectations, driven by the canned promise of… tuna? Reflect deeply. Then, if the answer is still "yes, open the blasted can," find the opener. Or a rock. We're not responsible for dental bills.</p>
