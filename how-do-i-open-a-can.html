        <h1>First, Question Reality. Then, Use a Can Opener.</h1>
        <p>Or, if you're feeling particularly daring, a rock. But honestly, just use the can opener. We believe in practical philosophy here at Cipher Nichu. It's much less messy. Unless you enjoy the metallic tang of existential dread mixed with diced tomatoes.</p>
