        <p>Or, you know, a can opener. But where's the fun in that? We at Cipher Nichu believe true can-opening comes from deep within. Channel your inner frustration, stare directly into the can's metallic soul, and *will* it open. If that fails, the aforementioned can opener is usually a safe bet. Good luck. You'll need it.</p>
