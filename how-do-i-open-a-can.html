    <h1>Embrace the Void. Then, Apply Can Opener.</h1>
    <p>Life's like a can, isn't it? Full of...stuff. The trick isn't just *opening* the can, it's accepting the inevitability of the contents – be it beans, soup, or the crushing weight of your own mortality. But seriously, use a can opener. They sell 'em at the store.</p>
