        <h1>First, Acquire the Can. Second... Question Everything.</h1>
        <p>Are you *sure* you want to open this can? What mysteries lie within? Is the desire for its contents merely a societal construct? Or are you truly, deeply, hungry? If it is the latter, consider a rock and a little determination. Good luck, seeker.</p>
