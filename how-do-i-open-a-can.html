        <h1>Stop. Question the Can.</h1>
        <p>Is it <em>really</em> a can? Or is it merely a societal construct, designed to confine deliciousness? Perhaps by pondering its essence, the barrier will simply... cease to be. Or, just get a can opener. We're not liable for starvation resulting from metaphysical debates.</p>
