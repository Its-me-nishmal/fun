        <h1>Open a Can? Why Not Open Your Mind?</h1>
        <p>Before you reach for that can opener, ask yourself: Is this can truly meant to be opened? Perhaps it holds secrets best left undisturbed. Maybe the contents are happier in their metallic home. Consider the implications. Then, if you *must*, twist the little handle thingy.</p>
