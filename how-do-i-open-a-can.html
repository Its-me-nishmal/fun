        <h1>Violently. Usually works.</h1>
        <p>Seriously though, the real question isn't <i>how</i> to open a can, but <i>why</i> are you opening a can? Are you hungry? Bored? Contemplating the futility of existence while staring at a tin of beans? We can't help with that. But a good can opener, and maybe a therapist, are probably the answer. Alternatively, just stab it with a screwdriver. Disclaimer: Cipher Nichu is not responsible for any injuries sustained while following this advice.</p>
