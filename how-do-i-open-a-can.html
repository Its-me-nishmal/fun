        <h1>The Real Question Is: *Should* You Open That Can?</h1>
        <p>Before you fumble with metal and edges, consider the deeper implications. Are you truly hungry, or just bored? Is there a more elegant solution to your culinary needs? Ponder. Then, if necessary, acquire a can opener. We are not responsible for existential can-opening crises.</p>
