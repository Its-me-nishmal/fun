        <h1>Open a Can? Question the Premise.</h1>
        <p>Before you reach for that antiquated "can opener," consider this: Are you *sure* you want to open it? What wonders lie within, sealed for all eternity? Perhaps the can is happier unopened. Or, you could just try spinning it really, really fast. Good luck!</p>
