        <h1>The Secret to Opening Any Can: Don't.</h1>
        <p>Let the can open itself. Think of it as Schrodinger's can. Until you observe the opening process, it's both open and unopened. Why rush perfection? Alternatively, invest in teleportation technology. Your food arrives, pre-digested, directly into your stomach. Problems solved. You're welcome.</p>
