        <h1>Embrace the Void. Then, use a Can Opener.</h1>
        <p>Sometimes, the most direct path is also the most…conventional. If the universe isn't cooperating with your bare hands and a blunt rock, consider that humble invention: the can opener. Or, failing that, call someone who knows what they're doing. We here at Cipher Nichu specialize in existential quandaries, not actually useful advice.</p>
