        <h1>How Do *You* Open a Can?</h1>
        <p>The real question isn't how to open a can, but *why*? Are you sure you're not already free? But, okay, fine, if you *really* need tuna: try a can opener. Twist. Lift. Or, you know, chuck it really hard at a brick wall. Cipher Nichu doesn't judge.</p>
