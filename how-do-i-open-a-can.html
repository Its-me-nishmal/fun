        <h1>With Extreme Prejudice (and possibly a can opener).</h1>
        <p>Alright, alright, settle down. Before you launch into a full-blown existential crisis over the inherent limitations of human existence manifest in the inability to open a cylindrical metal container, consider this: maybe the can doesn't <em>want</em> to be opened. Or maybe, just maybe, there's a little lever thingy involved. Failing that, brute force usually works. You're welcome. And stop Googling the obvious.</p>
