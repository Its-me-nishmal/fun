        <h1>Are you *sure* you want to know?</h1>
        <p>The true question isn't "how," but "should I?" Opening a can is a commitment. A responsibility. Are you ready for the consequences? Have you considered the philosophical ramifications of disrupting its perfectly sealed existence? Think. Then, maybe, just maybe, find a can opener. Or don't. The choice is yours.</p>
