        <h1>First, Question the Can.</h1>
        <p>Is the act of opening a can truly freeing the contents, or merely confining them to a different, less structured existence? Perhaps the can is the true container of potential, and we are simply imposing our will upon it... or, you know, just use a can opener. We sell those too, probably.</p>
