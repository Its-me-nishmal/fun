        <h1>Before Opening the Can, Ask Yourself: Why?</h1>
        <p>Is it truly necessary? Is there another way? Perhaps a different food entirely? Or maybe, just maybe, you're avoiding something deeper. We here at Cipher Nichu believe in exploring all options, even the ones involving a good, long stare into the void... and maybe also buying a can opener.</p>
