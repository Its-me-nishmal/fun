        <h1>First, Question Your Existence. THEN... maybe a can opener?</h1>
        <p>But consider this: is the can really closed? Or is it only your perception that confines its contents? Perhaps the answer lies not in *how* to open the can, but *why*... unless you're really hungry, in which case, a sturdy opener and a bit of elbow grease usually does the trick. Also consider the lid being pulled and twisted open these days.</p>
