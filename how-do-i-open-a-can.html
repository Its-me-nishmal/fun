        <h1>Embrace the Can. Transcend the Opening.</h1>
        <p>The true wisdom, seeker, lies not in *how* to open the can, but in understanding *why* you feel compelled to open it at all. Is it hunger? Or a deeper yearning for something more? Perhaps the can itself is a metaphor... but alright, fine. Twist the thingy on the can opener until it cuts around the lid. There. Happy now?</p>
