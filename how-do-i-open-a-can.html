        <h1>Embrace the Struggle. It's Character-Building (and Can-Opening).</h1>
        <p>Firstly, question the can. Why is it sealed so stubbornly? Is it a metaphor for your own repressed potential? Once you've navigated that existential crisis, maybe try hitting it with a rock. Or just ask a neighbor. We're more about the journey than the actual opened can, frankly.</p>
