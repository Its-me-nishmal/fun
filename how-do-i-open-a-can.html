        <h1>Step 1: Question Your Assumptions.</h1>
        <p>Before you even <i>think</i> about a can opener, ask yourself: is this can <i>truly</i> necessary? Could a more holistic, sustainable approach involve rethinking your entire relationship with canned goods? If the answer is yes, congratulations! You've transcended the need for opening cans entirely.</p>
