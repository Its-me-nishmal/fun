        <h1>The Answer? Regret Buying the Can.</h1>
        <p>Or, failing that, locate that dusty contraption known as a "can opener." But honestly, contemplating the impermanence of your desire for canned goods is a much more fulfilling activity. We at Cipher Nichu believe in alternative solutions, even if those solutions involve existential crises. Good luck!</p>
