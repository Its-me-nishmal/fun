        <h1>First, Question the Can Itself.</h1>
        <p>Before violently rending the metallic shell of your cylindrical companion, ask yourself: What am I truly seeking? Is it sustenance, or merely an escape from the gaping maw of ennui? Perhaps the can, in its stoic silence, holds the answers… or maybe it just contains beans. Either way, good luck with that pesky lid. Sometimes, a rock works wonders.</p>
