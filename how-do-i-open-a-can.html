        <h1>Embrace the Inevitable. The Can Will Open... Eventually.</h1>
        <p>Seriously though, if you're asking Google, you've probably already tried the can opener. Consider leveraging dark arts, bargaining with a raven, or simply accepting that some cans are destined to remain unopened, mocking our mortal efforts. Or, you know, try a hammer. (Cipher Nichu is not liable for any hammer-related injuries.)</p>
