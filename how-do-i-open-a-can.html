        <h1>Before You Open That Can, Ask Yourself: Why?</h1>
        <p>Seriously. Why *that* can? What cosmic forces led you to this precise moment? Is the soup calling to you, or are you merely a puppet in the kitchen of fate? Perhaps the true treasure wasn't the soup, but the questions we asked along the way. (But yeah, a can opener usually works.)</p>
