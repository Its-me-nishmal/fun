        <h1>First, Ask Yourself: *Why* Open a Can?</h1>
        <p>Is it hunger? Or a deeper, yearning for connection? Perhaps the can is a symbol of your unfulfilled potential, stubbornly resisting your attempts to access it. Before grabbing that can opener, consider the philosophical implications. Maybe the can is already open, if you only change your perspective. Or, you know, use the can opener. We're not judging.</p>
