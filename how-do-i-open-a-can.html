        <h1>Open a Can? Question Reality.</h1>
        <p>Before you even *think* about the can, ask yourself: Is this can truly necessary? What are the socio-economic implications of canned goods? Are you, perhaps, a can yourself? Only then, consider the can opener... or a hammer. We won't judge.</p>
