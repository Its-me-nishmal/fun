        <h1>Open a Can? Reconsider Everything.</h1>
        <p>Are you <em>sure</em> you need what's inside? Maybe the real treasure was the unopened can along the way. Also, check if you even *have* a can opener. If not, use a spoon and grit your teeth. Metaphorically, of course. We don't condone dental damage. Good luck, and remember: some cans are best left unopened. You've been warned.</p>
