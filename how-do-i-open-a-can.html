        <h1>First, ask: *Why* open the can?</h1>
        <p>Perhaps the true nourishment lies in the can's unopened potential, a symbol of unfulfilled possibilities. Or maybe you're just really hungry. In that case, pry it open with whatever you've got – a rock, a spoon, sheer willpower. We're not liable for injuries. Cipher Nichu disavows all culinary responsibility.</p>
