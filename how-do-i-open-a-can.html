        <h1>Embrace the Existential Dread. *Then* Open the Can.</h1>
        <p>Are you *sure* you want to open that can? It's a one-way trip, you know. Once the seal is broken, the contents are exposed to the harsh realities of the world. Think long and hard. Is the tuna *really* worth it? If so, try using a can opener. Alternatively, a hammer might work. We're not responsible for the mess. Enjoy your questionable culinary choices.</p>
