        <h1>First, Question the Can.</h1>
        <p>Before you attempt to breach its metallic shell, consider the can itself. A symbol of human ingenuity, yet also a prison for its contents. Is the desire to open it a true need, or merely a manifestation of societal conditioning? Once you've wrestled with these profound questions (and probably gotten hungry), just use a can opener. Or a rock. Cipher Nichu is not liable for injuries sustained while contemplating canned metaphysics.</p>
