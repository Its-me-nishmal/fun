        <h1>Open a Can? First, Open Your Mind.</h1>
        <p>The can isn't really the problem, is it? What are you *really* trying to open? A portal to flavor? A deeper understanding of tinned goods? Perhaps the can is just a metaphor... a metallic representation of your innermost fears. Get a can opener, sure, but maybe also a therapist. Cipher Nichu advises both, liberally.</p>
