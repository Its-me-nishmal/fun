        <h1>Here's how to fold a pizza box: You don't.</h1>
        <p>Seriously. Just... don't. Spend that energy enjoying the lingering aroma of pepperoni and regretting your life choices. The box is already doing its job. Embrace the beautiful, ungainly cardboard rectangle. It's a monument to deliciousness, not a personal failing. Besides, the grease stains are a feature, not a bug.</p>
