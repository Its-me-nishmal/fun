        <h1>It's the Color of Your Regrets (and a Tiny Bit of Green).</h1>
        <p>Don't overthink it. Mirrors reflect, they don't originate. Technically, there's a slight green tint due to the glass, but mostly it's just... you. And everything behind you. So, technically, your living room is the color of the mirror. Deep, right?</p>
