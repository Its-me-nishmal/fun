        <h1>Because Square Manhole Covers Were Too Good at Hiding in the Dark.</h1>
        <p>Seriously. Nobody could see them. We had more ankle injuries than a giraffe tap-dancing on roller skates. Plus, they kept challenging the round ones to geometry duels, and we all know how <i>that</i> ends. It's a matter of public safety, folks. Round = Safe-ish. Square = Ankle-Annihilation.</p>
