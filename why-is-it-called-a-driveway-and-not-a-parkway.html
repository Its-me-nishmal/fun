    <title>Driveway vs. Parkway: Because Cars Can't Park Themselves (Yet!)</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ever wondered why it's a driveway and not a parkway? The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind... or maybe it's because your car's more likely to *drive* than *park* itself into your garage. Driveway, parkway, semantic satiation, car logic, parking woes.">

        <h1>Because your car drives THERE, but parks HERE. Obvious, innit?</h1>
        <p>It's a linguistic mystery for the ages! But the simple truth is, you *drive* on a driveway to get to your house, and you probably *park* when you're... well, hopefully not on the driveway permanently. Unless you're really bad at parallel parking. Then it becomes a "park-WAY too close to the garage" situation.</p>
