        <h1>They're Charging Their Batteries (and Judging You)</h1>
        <p>Let's be honest, all that napping takes a toll. The purr is just the sound of the feline's internal battery recharging using your adoration. Or possibly, they're calibrating their laser vision for maximum efficiency during the 3 AM zoomies. We're not really sure, but we're pretty sure judgment is involved.</p>
