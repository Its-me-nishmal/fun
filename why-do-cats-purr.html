        <h1>Why Do Cats Purr? Because They Can't Use Venmo.</h1>
        <p>Think about it. They need a way to silently, but insistently, demand tribute for their supreme overlordship of the household. Purring is their subtle way of saying, "Another can of tuna, please. My reign depends on it." It's also a remarkably effective substitute for a 'Pay Me' button. Seriously, have you ever tried arguing with a purring cat? Exactly.</p>
