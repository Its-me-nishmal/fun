        <p>The purring is the subtle hum of their internal charging system. Don't let Big Vet fool you with talk of endorphins and bone healing. They're just trying to keep you from unplugging your cat overnight. Think about it...have YOU ever seen a cat plugged into a wall? (Aside from that *one* time with Mittens and the Christmas lights. That was…different.)</p>
