        <h1>Avoid It At All Costs.</h1>
        <p>Trust us. Microwave popcorn is a slippery slope. One minute you're enjoying slightly oily, vaguely buttery kernels, the next you're summoning the fire department because you thought "a few more seconds" was a good idea. There are better paths, friend. Seek them. Cipher Nichu guides you.</p>
