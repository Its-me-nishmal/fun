        <h1>Parallel Parking? A Conspiracy!</h1>
        <p>Here's the secret they don't want you to know: parallel parking isn't about skill, it's about blaming someone else. A badly calibrated GPS? Alien interference? Squirrel sabotage of the power steering? The possibilities are endless! Just remember: You're a victim, not a bad parker. (And maybe practice on Google Maps street view...just in case the aliens are busy).</p>
