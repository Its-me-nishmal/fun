        <h1>"There." As in, "My Patience Went There."</h1>
        <p>Listen, spelling "there" isn't the problem. The problem is <i>why</i> you need to spell "there." Is it a location? A possessive pronoun belonging to a group of grammar gremlins? Or a contraction signifying their very existence? Think about <i>that</i>, and the letters will fall into place. Or, you know, just Google it again. We won't judge. Much.</p>
